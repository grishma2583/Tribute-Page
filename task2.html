        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam (born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong) was an Indian 
            scientist and politician who played a leading role in the development of India’s missile and nuclear weapons 
            programs. He was president of India from 2002 to 2007. United States President Barack Obama extended "deepest 
            condolences to the people of India on the passing of former Indian President Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam", and 
            highlighted his achievements as a scientist and as a statesman, notably his role in strengthening US–India 
            relations and increasing space cooperation between the two nations.</p>

        <h2>Missile Man</h2>
        <p>Abdul Kalam was also, unusually for an Indian who occupied the high positions he did, a man of great simplicity.
            During his 25 years as a scientist based in Thiruvananthapuram, the constituency I now represent in 
            parliament, he endeared himself to ordinary people everywhere.</p>
